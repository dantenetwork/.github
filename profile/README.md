Dante Network is an Omniverse infrastructure of Web3 for collaboration among multiple ecosystems, just as an "Internet protocol stack" is for the current Internet. Dante Network builds a bi-direction connection for smart contracts deployed on heterogeneous public chains to cooperate with each other. The scientific problem we are solving is how to connect two trusted consensus spaces through a trustless off-chain environment without any assumption. A Verifiable Proof of Fraud along with an effecient Verifiable Passive Challenge mechanism without waiting time window are used to make all off-chain nodes face a prisoner's dilemma, within which the best strategy for them is doing honest things.  
We persist in building Dante Protocol in an absolute open and decentralized way, based on which security of interaction between isolated heterogeneous consensus spaces can be guaranteed with high degree of certainty. Yes the security can be guaranteed with no doubt.
