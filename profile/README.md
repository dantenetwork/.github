Dante Network is an Omniverse infrastructure of Web3 for collaboration among multiple ecosystems. In Dante Network, we define and implement a protocol stack for Web3 to realize the interconnection and interoperability, which will bring innovative experience for Web3, just as an "Internet protocol stack" is for the current Internet. Dante Network builds a bi-direction connection for smart contracts deployed on heterogeneous public chains to cooperate with each other. The scientific problem we are solving is how to connect two trusted consensus spaces through a trustless off-chain environment without any assumption. Cryptography methods are adopted to provide non-repudiation and non-forgeability, along with a Multi-level Gaming Model to provide a prisoner's dilemma like situation for participants to do honestly as their best strategy, which is also a nash equilibrium.
